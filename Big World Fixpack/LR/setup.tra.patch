 The Seldarine had been watching Irenicus’s stubborn climb to power with terrified fascination of birds paralyzed by a snake. But once he entered their Realm – the peaceful and glorious Plane of Arvandor – they closed their ranks against him. Realizing that even his newly acquired divine status was no match for the combined powers of the Seldarine, the Exile played a dangerous game and issued a challenge to Correllon Larethian himself. But the leader of the Seldarine declined the duel on behalf of Rillifane Rallathil, who was seething with anger and sorrow over the demise of his daughter. In a series of magical battles that shook the very base of the Planes, the grieving god of Woodlands defeated Irenicus and his numerous demonic allies, and drove him away from Arvandor.
 Rillifane was, however, unable to strip the Exile of his stolen divinity. In the end, the Seldarine were forced to sign an uneasy truce. Joneleth Irenicus became the first elven god of Vengeance and the Dark Magical Arts. He resides in his own Realm of Enuma Elish, a small sub-plane within the Plane of Grey Waste, and answers the prayers of those destitute elves who, like himself, have fallen sour of the kind and lighthearted ways of the Seldarine.~
 @111  = ~Following the conclusion of his uneasy bargain with <CHARNAME>, Irenicus obtained the soul of one of the godchild’s rival siblings. Having sarcastically congratulated <CHARNAME> on <PRO_HISHER> victory, and with a new divine soul at hand, the Exile restored himself, once again defying the curse of the Seldarine and mocking their justice. He then proceeded to retrace his steps over the land of Faerun, visiting both his old laboratory in Athkatla, and his base in Spellhold and collecting the ruined machinery and other arcane accoutrement. Once he had completed these tasks, Irenicus vanished from the face of Toril and was not seen for several decades.
-But, perhaps predictably, the mage did not disappear for good, and his return swept the peaceful glades of Tethir as a devastating hurricane. Irenicus’s final assault on Suldanessellar was more deadly than his previous one, and this time <CHARNAME>, did not rush to Suldanessellar’s aid, for either the godchild never learned of the attack, or <PRO_SHEHE> simply no longer cared about the city’s plight. One by one, Suldanessellar’s defenses fell, and Irenicus entered the very heart of the city, tracking down Ellesime and disabling her elaborate traps.

 Long had she expected him to come… Indeed, the Queen had spent decades bitterly reproving <CHARNAME>’s treachery and strengthening her protections. But when it came to facing her former lover again, Ellesime was no match for Joneleth’s wrath. Once she realized Irenicus was once again intent on capturing her alive to use her as a link to the Tree, Ellesime committed an act of ultimate sacrifice, ending her physical existence in a burst of magical fire, and departing in soul to the beckoning shores of Arvandor. 
 Ellesime’s brave escape from his ultimate revenge was a terrible blow to Irenicus’s schemes, since even the soul of <CHARNAME>’s sibling was not powerful enough to allow him to sustain the link with the Tree of Life all by himself. Yet Joneleth was too vain to abandon his plan of becoming a god, and the sight of his former lover committing suicide before his very eyes only strengthened his resolve. 
 Once Irenicus had reestablished his link with the Tree of Life, its majestic trunk and crone burst into flames, soon engulfing the defiant mage, and this time there was no one around to quench Joneleth’s blazing flesh. Irenicus was burned to fine ashes, leaving no trace of himself on the tortured earth. His very soul was consumed by the magic fire, and he embraced the true and ultimate death, with no possible return or restoration. His funeral pyre was the grandest in the Realms though, for it annihilated the entire population of Suldanessellar, and the long-suffering symbol of the mage’s obsession – the elven Tree of Life.~
